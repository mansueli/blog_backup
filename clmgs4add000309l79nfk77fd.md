* **Ease of Use**: Supabase simplifies database management with an intuitive interface, catering to developers of all skill levels.
    

### Planning the Migration Process

Before diving into the technical aspects, meticulous planning is paramount for a seamless migration. Considerations like data mapping, schema design, and data transformation require careful attention. As discussed in our previous article on ["Exploring Data Relationships with Supabase and PostgreSQL"](https://blog.mansueli.com/exploring-data-relationships-with-supabase-and-postgresql), understanding your data's structure is a crucial initial step.

## Running the Migration

You can run the migration process using this Colab notebook I've prepared for your convenience. It provides step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth transition from MongoDB to Supabase with PostgreSQL. Below, we'll go through the steps to set it up yourself:

## Preparing Your Environment

### Installing the Required Python Libraries

Let's begin by installing the essential Python libraries for your migration journey:

```python
pip install mongo
pip install psycopg2
```

## Setting Up Connection URIs

To begin the migration process, it's essential to configure the connection URIs for both MongoDB and Supabase. Make sure you have your credentials ready and set the environment variables as shown below:

```python
# Source DB variables:
%env supabase_uri=postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxasaxx.supabase.co:5432/
%env mongo_uri=mongodb+srv://nacho:password@cluster001.jjj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
%env mongo_db=sample_mflix
```

## Running the Migration Manually

### Mapping Data Types

Mapping data types from MongoDB to PostgreSQL is a crucial step in the migration process. The provided script handles these conversions intelligently based on the Python types encountered in your MongoDB data. For example, it recognizes `ObjectId` and correctly maps it to the equivalent PostgreSQL data type. This ensures that your data retains its integrity throughout the migration process.

Here's how data types are mapped in the script:

```python
# Mapping MongoDB types to PostgreSQL types
SQL_DATA_TYPE = {
    "string": "TEXT",
    "ObjectId": "TEXT",
    "datetime": "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE",
    "int": "INT",
    "list": "JSONB",
    "dict": "JSONB",
    "bool": "Boolean",
    "float": "NUMERIC",
    "default": "TEXT",
}
```

### Creating PostgreSQL Tables

Creating the necessary tables in PostgreSQL is seamlessly handled by the provided script. If a table doesn't already exist for a MongoDB collection, the script creates one. Additionally, it checks for existing tables to avoid duplicates. This ensures that your data is organized efficiently in the PostgreSQL database, making it ready for further use.

In the script, you have the flexibility to specify the target MongoDB database using the `mongo_db_manual` variable. If left empty, the script will run for all databases in MongoDB.

For databases with more resources, consider including `collection.find(no_cursor_timeout=True)` in the code to prevent cursor timeouts during the migration.

## Migration code

Here's the migration code that establishes connections, maps data types, and creates PostgreSQL tables:

```python
from bson.decimal128 import Decimal128
import pymongo
import psycopg2
from psycopg2.extensions import AsIs
import json
from datetime import datetime
from psycopg2 import sql, extensions, connect, Error
from bson import ObjectId
import os

mongo_url = os.environ['mongo_uri']
supabase_url = os.environ['supabase_uri']

class CustomEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, ObjectId):
          return str(obj)
        if isinstance(obj, datetime):
          return obj.isoformat()
        if isinstance(obj, Decimal128):
          return str(obj)
        if isinstance(obj, complex):
            return [obj.real, obj.imag]
        return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)


psycopg2.extensions.register_adapter(Decimal128, lambda val: AsIs(str(val.to_decimal())))

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_url)
# Connect to PostgreSQL
pg_conn = connect(supabase_url)
pg_conn.set_isolation_level(extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT)
pg_cur = pg_conn.cursor()

# Mapping MongoDB types to PostgreSQL types
SQL_DATA_TYPE = {
  "str": "TEXT",
  "ObjectId": "TEXT",
  "datetime.datetime": "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE",
  "datetime": "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE",
  "int": "INT",
  "list": "JSONB",
  "dict": "JSONB",
  "bool": "Boolean",
  "float": "NUMERIC",
  "default": "TEXT",
  "NoneType":"TEXT",
  "Decimal128":"NUMERIC",
}

# Store the type of each field
field_types = {}

# Get the list of database names from MongoDB
mongo_db_manual = os.environ['mongo_db']
mongo_db_names = []
if(len(mongo_db_manual)>0):
  mongo_db_names.append(mongo_db_manual)
else:
  mongo_db_names = mongo_client.list_database_names()

# Iterate over all MongoDB databases
for db_name in mongo_db_names:
    print("Starting to migrate :"+ str(db_name))
    mongo_db = mongo_client[db_name]

    # Iterate over all collections in the current database
    for collection_name in mongo_db.list_collection_names():
        # Skip system collections
        if collection_name.startswith("system."):
            continue

        collection = mongo_db[collection_name]
        # Create table in PostgreSQL if it doesn't exist
        pg_cur.execute(sql.SQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {} ()").format(
            sql.Identifier(collection_name)))

        # Iterate over all documents in the collection
        cursor = collection.find()
        for document in cursor:
            # For each document, build a list of fields and a list of values
            fields = []
            values = []
            for field, value in document.items():
                # Determine PostgreSQL type based on Python type
                if isinstance(value, ObjectId):
                    pg_type = SQL_DATA_TYPE["ObjectId"]
                    value = str(value)
                else:
                    pg_type = SQL_DATA_TYPE.get(type(value).__name__, SQL_DATA_TYPE["default"])

                # Add type suffix to field name if a new type is encountered
                field_with_type = field
                if field in field_types:
                    if type(value).__name__ not in field_types[field]:
                        field_types[field].add(type(value).__name__)
                        field_with_type = f"{field}_{type(value).__name__}"
                else:
                    field_types[field] = {type(value).__name__}

                # Add column in PostgreSQL if it doesn't exist
                try:
                    pg_cur.execute(sql.SQL("ALTER TABLE {} ADD COLUMN {} {}").format(
                        sql.Identifier(collection_name),
                        sql.Identifier(field_with_type),
                        sql.SQL(pg_type)))
                except Error:
                    pass  # Column already exists, no action needed

                # Add field and value to the lists
                fields.append(sql.Identifier(field_with_type))
                if isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(value, dict):
                    value = json.dumps(value, cls=CustomEncoder)
                values.append(value)

            # Insert data into PostgreSQL
            pg_cur.execute(sql.SQL("INSERT INTO {} ({}) VALUES ({})").format(
                sql.Identifier(collection_name),
                sql.SQL(', ').join(fields),
                sql.SQL(', ').join(sql.Placeholder() * len(values))),
                values)

pg_cur.close()
pg_conn.close()
```

This script simplifies the migration process by automating many of the essential tasks.
